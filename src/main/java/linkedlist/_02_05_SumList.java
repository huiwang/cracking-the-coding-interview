/**
 * Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list,
 * where each node contains a single digit.
 * The digits are stored in normal order, such that the 1 's digit is at the tail of the list.
 * Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input:(7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).That is, 716 + 592.
 * Output:1 -> 4 -> 0 -> 8.That is, 1408.
