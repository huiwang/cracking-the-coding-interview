 * Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the

 * <p>
 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C[the same C as earlier]
 * Output: C
