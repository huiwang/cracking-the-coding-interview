 * Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than
 * x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values
 * of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can
 * appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right
 * partitions. EXAMPLE Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1[partition=5] Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 ->
 * 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
