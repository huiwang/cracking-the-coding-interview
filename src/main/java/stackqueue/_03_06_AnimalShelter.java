/**
 * An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out"
 * basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the
 * shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest
 * animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like.
 *
 * <p>Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue,
 * dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat.
 *
 * <p>You may use the built-in Linked list data structure.
