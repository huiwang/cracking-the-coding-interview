/**
 * Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
 * A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
 * A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
 * The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE
