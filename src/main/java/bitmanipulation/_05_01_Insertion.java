/**
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to
 * insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j
 * through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are
 * at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M
 * could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 *
 * <p>EXAMPLE Input: N 10000000000, M 10011, i 2, j 6 Output:N = 10001001100
