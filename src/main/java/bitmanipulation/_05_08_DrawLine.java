/**
 * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be
 * stored in one byte.
 *
 * <p>The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across
 * rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the
 * width.
 *
 * <p>Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to ( x2, y).
 *
 * <p>for example, if screen has a width 16 and a height 2. | encoded as 0 and - as 1 | | | | | | |
 * | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
 *
 * <p>drawing a line from (2, 1) to (13, 1) gives the following result | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
 * | | | - - - - - - - - - - - - | |
