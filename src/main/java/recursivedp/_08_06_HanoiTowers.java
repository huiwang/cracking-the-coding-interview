/**
 * In the classic problem of the towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes
 * which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size
 * from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following
 * constraints: (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. (2) A disk is slid off the top of one
 * tower onto another tower. (3) A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk. Write a program
 * to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
