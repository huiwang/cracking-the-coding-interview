/**
 * In the classic problem of the towers of Hanoi,
 * you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower.
 * The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom
 * (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one).
 * You have the following constraints:
 * (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
 * (3) A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 * Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
