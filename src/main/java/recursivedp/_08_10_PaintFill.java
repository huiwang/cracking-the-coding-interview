 * Paint Fill: Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing programs.
 * That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point, and a new color,
 * fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color.
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE
 * <p>
 * [0, 1, 1]
 * [1, 1, 0]
 * [1, 0, 0]
 * <p>
 * Given a new point at (2, 2) and new color 2, the expected screen after paint filling should be
 * [0, 1, 1]
 * [1, 1, 2]
 * [1, 2, 2]
