 * Paint Fill: Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing
 * programs. That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point,
 * and a new color, fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color.
 *
 * <p>EXAMPLE
 *
 * <p>[0, 1, 1] [1, 1, 0] [1, 0, 0]
 *
 * <p>Given a new point at (2, 2) and new color 2, the expected screen after paint filling should be
 * [0, 1, 1] [1, 1, 2] [1, 2, 2]
